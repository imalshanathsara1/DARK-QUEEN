# Baileys JS - v6.2.1
### You may wonder what in the earth is this. Let me expain: 
- It is compiled version of Baileys with some modifications by [Me](https://github.com/FantoX001) to fix some issues.
- It is [WhiskeySockets/Baileys](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys) `v6.2.1` but modified after compilation.
- It is originally made by [Adhiraj Singh](https://github.com/adiwajshing) as `@adiwajshing/baileys` but currently being republished and maintained as `@whiskeySockets/baileys`.
- ðŸ“ˆ Advantage of it: `Fixed 503 Service unavailable crash issue in JS.`
- ðŸ“‰ Disadvantage of it: `As it's local modified version so to update it I have to recode new released version in future so Baileys update might take some time.`
